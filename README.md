Kalman Filter - For Spatio-Temporal data
===================


This is an adaptation of [lacker/ikalman](https://github.com/lacker/ikalman) for Java.
The code was rewritten and the tests were transformed in JUnit test cases.

Since the project uses Maven it is pretty straight forward to run the tests and get everything working.


How to use

Check the tests cases to understand the usage of the classes.
