Kalman Filter - For Spatio-Temporal data
===================


This is an adaptation of [lacker/ikalman](https://github.com/lacker/ikalman) for Java.
The code was rewritten and the tests were transformed in JUnit test cases.

Since the project uses Maven it pretty straight foward to run the tests and get everything working.
